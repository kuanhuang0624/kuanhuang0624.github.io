I received an internal funding [Students Partnering with Faculty (SpF) 2023](https://www.kean.edu/offices/research-and-sponsored-programs/internal-funding-research/students-partnering-faculty-spf) on Deep Learning-Based Breast Ultrasound Image Analysis.
This is a single-PI, 1-year grant with $16,000 budget.
