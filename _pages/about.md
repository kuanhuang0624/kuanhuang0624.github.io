I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Kean University (Union, NJ). 
Before working at Kean, I was a post-doctoral research fellow at the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center and the Department of 
Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at 
Utah State University (Logan, UT) in 2021 and my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology (Harbin, China) in 2016.

My research interests include artificial intelligence, computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition.
